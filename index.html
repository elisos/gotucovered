            <p id="testimonial1">In all my experience, Judith is the most honest, caring and sincere person I have ever bought from. I'm so happy with the wig I bought. Everyone thinks it cost a fortune, and I get compliments on it every time I wear it. I'm so thankful for your advice. I couldn't be happier. Keep up the good work. I just wish I lived in Israel so I could do the washes and sets by you. TM</p>
            <p id="testimonial2">Whoever hasn't visited the GOT U COVERED salon in Ramat Beit Shemesh, you better do it!! I'm so impressed with the selection and quality of their wigs. The women that work there are patient, honest and fun! It was a totally different experience than what I've had at other places. Highly recommend them! MK</p>
            <p id="testimonial3">Love, love, love my sheitel Judith!! Thanks so much for your time. CK</p>
            <p id="testimonial4">K, so maybe I was greedy buying three wigs but I don't know when I'm coming back to Israel, and I basically spent the same amount of money on three that I easily could have on one. FG</p>
            <p id="testimonial5">If anyone wants to buy a high-quality wig without breaking the bank, call GOT U COVERED. They have everything you need. Quality, great prices, and great personalities.</p>
